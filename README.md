## Legit-Game-Engine Web

LGE Web is a heavily modified version of my [homegrown engine](https://github.com/brock-eng/Legit-Game-Engine) that uses Emscripten, a C++ compiler that converts my native C++/OpenGL code into an html, javascript, and WebGL application.  The entire thing is pretty scary and might actually be black magic but it works wonders with little to no performance hits when converting.
